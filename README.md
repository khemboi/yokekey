# Why Unlicense?
Free code, if someone can make a better version and sell it, awesome, but I don't want anyone restricted using this tool. For now (2021) it will be for building websites, maybe other things in the future if possible.

# What inspired this?

My teacher Mr. Anderson in highschool had us learn programming through a website that let us drag and drop code to solve problems and would challenge us using the least lines. Also my pal Nile and I both agreed we hated coding as is but loved making things with it. So I thought, hey, it'd be cool if that website let us drag and drop to code anything without restrictions. Thus YoKeKey was born.

# Why YoKeKeY?

Yolk-Key or YoKeKey inspired by the infamous hacker known as 4chan, also I don't want to get sued by Nintendo or some other software company in the future so lets go with Yo-KEK-Key.

# Why those colors?

I hate boring looking software.

# Why not just use an IDE or NotePad?

I want this to be small and crossplatform, while doing something I don't see in any other programming tool thats FREE TO USE FOREVER. Those things are helping me now but the goal is to use this and only this with no regrets, also it's a good challenge to build.
